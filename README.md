# Welcome to my third project made for ironhack

I had to create a project of a web page for buying and selling second hand games and consoles made with: HTML, SCSS, Javascript, Node.js, React. I had to do it in two weeks and I had to present it at ironhack.

The website is called ** boxGame **, in which the user can register to offer both games and consoles for sale by which the potential buyer can be contacted through an email address.

##  Experience :
  
It was an intense two week, divided by tasks to be done by days, each day towards a different part of the web starting from the back part to the front part. Truth is learned a lot by doing this type of practice that allows you to demonstrate what you have learned and learn many new things that are generated at the code level.
